Directions: When running this program, the first screen is a Login screen that needs a username and password to login. Once logged in, the appointment Calendar and Customer list populates.
            From this screen, appointments and customers can be added or updated by using the buttons under the appropriate table view. These buttons will navigate to the necessary screen.
            Once the save, cancel, or delete buttons are selected as necessary on the add or update screens, the user is directed back to Appointment Calendar and Customer screen.
            Finally, the user can access an additional reports page from the Appointment Calendar and Customer screen by using the reports button. The reports screen allows the user to filter
            Three tables by either: month and type of appointment, contact associated with the appointment, or user that created the appointment. The back button will then navigate back to
            the Appointment Calendar and Customer screen. The user can exit the program by using the cancel button on the login screen, the x in the top right corner of each screen, or by
            using the logout button at the top of the Appointment Calendar and Customer screen which will take the user back to the login screen then use the cancel button.
Additional Info: an additional report for the A3f section uses users as a filter for appointments so that it can be seen who created the appointment(s).
